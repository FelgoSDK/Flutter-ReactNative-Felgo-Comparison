# Flutter, React Native & Felgo: Cross-platform Framework Comparison

In the article we compared Felgo and two of the most popular cross-platform frameworks: Flutter and React Native. Here you can find various sample appilications, from the mandatory "Hello World" to real-world scenarios implemented using the three Frameworks.

Overall with Felgo, we measured less lines of code with more platform supported, but don't trust our words, check our code.
